# üåô DreamTracker

DreamTracker is a full-stack web application designed to help users capture, reflect on, and explore their dreams‚Äîprivately or communally. By combining personal journaling features with light social integration, DreamTracker empowers users to find meaning in their subconscious experiences and connect with others through shared dream patterns.

---

## Why DreamTracker?

Most dream journaling apps focus solely on private reflection. DreamTracker goes further by:

- **Making dreams searchable** with tags, emotions, and categories
- **Allowing optional anonymous sharing** to foster connection without oversharing
- **Highlighting patterns** across a user‚Äôs dream history
- **Offering a calm, minimal interface** optimized for night-time or early-morning logging
- **Includes an AI-powered ‚ÄúRewrite‚Äù tool** that helps structure dreams written as raw notes or fragmented memories

> DreamTracker is built to support introspection and subtle community‚Äîwithout gamification or dopamine traps.

## How to Run DreamTracker

This project includes both a .NET backend and a Vite/React frontend. The fastest way to run both is with `make serve`, which handles everything for you.

---

### üîß Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following are installed:

* **.NET 8.0 SDK**
  Verify with:

  ```bash
  dotnet --version
  ```

  The output should start with `8.` ‚Äî if not, [download it here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

* **PostgreSQL**
  Ensure `psql` is available from the command line.

* **EF Core CLI (`dotnet-ef`)**

  > ‚ÑπÔ∏è You do **not** need to install this manually ‚Äî the `Makefile` will install it automatically if it's missing.


* **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** (Optional)
  Required for the **"Rewrite with AI"** feature during dream creation. You must have Ollama installed and at least one non-embedding model pulled.

> üöÄ The application automatically uses the most recently pulled usable model.


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soyuz43/DreamTracker.git
cd DreamTracker
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ User Secrets (Required)
  The application expects a PostgreSQL connection string stored in user secrets under the key `DreamTrackerDbConnectionString`.
  Set it using:

  ```bash
  dotnet user-secrets init
  dotnet user-secrets set "DreamTrackerDbConnectionString" "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Username=postgres;Password=yourpassword;Database=DreamTracker"
  ```



#### (Optional) Configure Admin & User Passwords

You can set local passwords for the seeded admin and user accounts using the .NET Secret Manager:

```bash
cd DreamTrackerAPI
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "AdminUser:Password" "<your_admin_password>"
dotnet user-secrets set "DefaultUser:Password" "<your_user_password>"
```

These credentials will be injected at runtime when the app seeds the database.

**Default users created on startup:**

| Role  | Email                                             | Password (if unset)    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Admin | [admina@strator.comx](mailto:admina@strator.comx) | `DefaultAdminPassword` |
| User  | [lucy@dream.com](mailto:lucy@dream.com)           | `DefaultUserPassword`  |

> `.NET user-secrets` comes with the SDK ‚Äî no install required.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Easiest Way to Run: `make serve`

```bash
make serve
```

This command will:

* Check for and install backend dependencies (`dotnet ef`)
* Ensure `dotnet-ef` is installed globally
* Check for and install frontend dependencies (`npm install`)
* Launch the backend with HTTPS (`dotnet watch run`)
* Wait eight seconds
* Start the frontend dev server


Once it‚Äôs ready:

* **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
* **Backend API**: [https://localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001)

> You can run the backend and frontend separately if you prefer ‚Äî see below.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Setup (Optional)

#### üñ•Ô∏è Backend

```bash
cd DreamTrackerAPI
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run --launch-profile https
```

> Launching with `--launch-profile https` ensures Swagger UI and HTTPS endpoints work correctly.

#### üåê Frontend

```bash
cd DreamTracker-Client
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Resetting the Database (Destructive)

If you want to delete all migrations and recreate the database:

```bash
make migrations
```

This command will:

* Remove EF Core migration files
* Drop the PostgreSQL `DreamTracker` database
* Recreate the schema from scratch

Before doing this, make sure your connection string is configured via user-secrets:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DreamTrackerDb" "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Username=postgres;Password=your_password;Database=DreamTracker"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only use this if you're resetting your dev environment. It **deletes everything**.
